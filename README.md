# Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The analysis includes text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, and classification using Logistic Regression.

## 🧠 Project Features

- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization of reviews
- Logistic Regression for sentiment classification
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Prediction on new input

## 📁 Files Included

- `Sentiment_Analysis_Logistic_TFIDF.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full code

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`

## 📊 Output

- Displays whether a review is Positive or Negative
- Prints confusion matrix and accuracy of the model

## ✨ Future Scope

- Experiment with different classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
- Add more sophisticated text cleaning (lemmatization, stop word tuning)
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
